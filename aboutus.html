      <h1>What is BeCool?</h1>
      <p>BeCool is a student project started with the aim to decrease food insecurity and food waste in Canada by not only raising awareness of community fridges in the greater Vancouver area, 
        but also by facilitating the accessibility and contribution of food to those fridges. We aim to equip users with the ability to visualize food resources donated by the community 
        from the comfort of their homes, so those suffering from food scarcity and insecurity are not only made aware of available fresh food nearby, 
        but are also able to plan their routes and meals. 
        To those with resources to give, we aim to help ease the process of locating available spaces 
        nearby as well as keeping track of donations that could have otherwise become foodwaste in their homes. </p>

    <div id="about-us1">
      <h1>What is a community fridge?</h1>
      <p>Community fridges are exactly what they sound like,
         fridges put in place by the community where people donate what they can, 
         and take what they need. These fridges work on an honor system and are widely 
         regarded as a judgement free zone. Our app provides a way to track the food in 
         the community fridges so people may know how long food has been sitting there for,
         and so that a hopeful trip is not wasted upon arrival of an empty fridge.</p>

    <div id="about-us1">
      <h1>What is food insecurity?</h1>
      <p>Not everyone is aware of how prevelant food insecurity is in Canada,
        let alone what that even means. To put it quite simply, food insecurity
        is the uncertainty of having enough food, or good quality food, 
        available to you on a daily basis to lead a happy and healthy life. 
        To those of us fortunate enough to have never found ourselves in this situation, 
        it is easy to forget what others in our community may be going through, 
        as not everything is prevelant to the eyes of an outsider. </p>
