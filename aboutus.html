      <h1>What is BeCool?</h1>
      <p>BeCool is a student project started with the aim to derease food insecurity and food waste in Canada by not only raising awareness of community fridges in the greater Vancouver area, but also by facilitating he accessibility and contribution of food to those fridges. We aim to equip users with the ability to visualize food resources donated by the community from the comfort of their homes, so those suffering from food scarcity and insecutiry are not only made aware of available fresh food nearby, but are also able to plan their routes and meals. To those with resources to give, we aim to help ease the process of locating available spaces nearby as well as keeping track of donations that could have otherwise become foodwaste in their homes. </p>

      <h1>What is a community fridge?</h1>
      <p>Community fridges are exactly what they sound like, fridges put in place by the community where people donate what they can, and take what they need. These fridges work on an honor system and are widely regarded as a judgement free zone. Our app provides a way to track the food in the community fridges so people may know how long food has been sitting there for, the shelf life of the donated food, and so that a hopeful trip is not wasted upon arrival of an empty fridge.</p>

      <h1>What is food insecurity?</h1>
      <p>Not everyone is aware of how prevelant food insecurity is in Canada, let alone what that even means. To put it quite simply, food insecurity is the uncertainty of having enough food, or good quality food, available to you on a daily basis to lead a happy and healthy life. To those of us fortunate enough to have never found ourselves in this situation, it is easy to forget what others in our community may be going through, as not everything is prevelant to the eyes of an outsider. </p>
